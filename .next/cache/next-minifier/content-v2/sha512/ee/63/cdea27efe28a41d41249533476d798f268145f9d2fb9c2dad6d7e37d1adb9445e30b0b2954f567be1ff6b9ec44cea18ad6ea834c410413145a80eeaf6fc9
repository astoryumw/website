A Computer Science student at the time, I started thinking about different projects I could work on. My mind settled on this one; make a cubing website with a stopwatch and give the users a database that they can save their time to, just like the times list. And then, with the knowledge I gained in CPSC 350 Applications of Databases and stack overflow, I took off.\",h(\"br\",null),\"I\\u2019m graduating in Spring 2021 and due to covid, haven\\u2019t been on campus in over a year. Though whether any other students remember this or not, I almost always had my 3x3x3 cube with me. I\\u2019m sure most people thought I was a geek who liked cubes, which is definitely true, but I think there is a bit more to it.\",h(\"p\",null),h(\"br\",null),\"In the summer of 2010 I suffered a severe Traumatic Brain Injury. The day of the injury I had gone out mountain climbing. Whether this was what made me fall or not I don\\u2019t know, I have no memory of it happening, but the consensus is that I was crossing over a stream on the side of the mountain, slipped, hit my head, and fell unconscious. My went body limp and I fell about 50 feet. My father was able to secure my body, a friend\\u2019s mother called 911 and thus, the journey began.\",h(\"p\",null),h(\"br\",null),\"A helicopter air lifted me to the ICU where I underwent surgery to repair my fractured skull. A bit lucky in a weird sort of way, but my skull was the only thing broken. Other than some scratches and bruises, the rest of my body was fine. After the surgery, I was placed in a coma for 6 days. After regaining conscious, I spent 10 more days in the ICU before being transferred to the hospital where my healing would really take off: the Kennedy Krieger Institute.\",h(\"p\",null),h(\"br\",null),\"I have been told that things were always in fruition, I was making progress daily but for about half of my stay in the center I have no memory. I do remember when I began to talk again, when I began to walk again, when I began to eat again and I do remember  the great care I had, from the nurses, doctors and therapists; I was in a great place to heal. I am especially thankful to my parents because they had to deal with me after I came home. Healing didn\\u2019t stop after I left the hospital, neither did learning about myself.\",h(\"p\",null),h(\"br\",null),\"Two years later I took the Rubik\\u2019s cube out of my mother\\u2019s draw. As a lot of cubers know, many people that do not know how to solve the cube often do the same thing; they take the cube apart and attempt to put the pieces in the spot they go. I had taken the pieces out about a year ago, not put them back, and thinking the cube was broken had just put the cube in the drawer. Then, a year later, I took the cube out, put the piece back in and learned to solve it.\",h(\"p\",null),h(\"br\",null),\"I only knew the beginner method at this point, but I was happy that I had learned to solve the cube. I continued to solve it almost religiously, even taking it places like school or church; it was always with me. I decided to learn more about the cube and faster ways to solve it. First came F2L, 2-look OLL and 2-look PLL. I was happy for the time being, but eventually started something else that I still do today. From my brain injury, I had gained one thing that is still with me today, a tremor in my right hand. As a one handed cuber, I researched new ways to solve the cube quickly and learned about the ZZ method. To put it shortly, with the method the cube can be solved with only L, U, and R moves. Which means it\\u2019s perfect for one handed cubers.\",h(\"p\",null),h(\"br\",null),\"Of course, this method solves the cross at the top, so I only had to learn 7 OLL algorithms and after that 21 PLL algorithms.\",h(\"p\",null),h(\"br\",null),\"I think the cube helped me to overcome my brain injury. With the cube, I\\u2019ve always been able to focus on it for hours.
