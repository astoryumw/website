A Computer Science, I started thinking about different projects I could work on. My mind settled on this one; make a cubing website with a stopwatch and give the users a database that they can save their time to, just like the times list.

The day of the injury I had gone out mountain climbing. Whether this was what made me fall or not I don\\u2019t know, I have no memory of it happening, but the consensus is that I was crossing over a stream on the side of the mountain, slipped, hit my head, and fell unconscious. My body limp, I fell about 50 feet.

A bit lucky in a weird sort of way, but my skull was the only thing broken. Other than some scratches and bruises, the rest of my body was fine. After the surgery, I was placed in a coma for 6 days. After regaining conscious, I spent 10 more days in the ICU before being transferred to the hospital where my healing would really take off: the Kennedy Krieger Institute.\", __jsx(\"p\", null), __jsx(\"br\", null), \"I have been told that things were always in fruition, I was making progress daily but for about half of my stay in the center I have no memory. I do remember when I began to talk again, when I began to walk again, when I began to eat again and I do remember  the great care I had, from the nurses, doctors, therapists, I was in a great place to heal. I am especially thankful to my parents because they had to deal with me after I came home.

As a lot of cubers know, many people that do not know how to solve the cube often do the same thing; they take the cube apart and attempt to put the pieces in the spot they go.

I continued to solve it almost religiously, even taking it places like school or church; it was always with me. I decided to learn more about the cube and faster ways to solve it. First came F2L, 2-look OLL (orient last layer) and 2-look PLL (permute last layer). I was happy for the time being, but eventually started something else that I still do today. From my brain injury, I had gained one thing that is still with me today, a tremor in my right hand. As a one handed cuber, I researched new ways to solve the cube quickly and learned about the ZZ method. To put it shortly, the method always the cube to be solved with only L, U, and R moves.
